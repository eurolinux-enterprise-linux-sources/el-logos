In the interests of encouraging modification, I've decided to release all artwork that ''does not''' contain the actual SL logo under the <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/> license, just to ensure we have an actual license this time. Some objects may be considered public domain because they only consist of a basic gradient or just text. In those cases, I am presuming that ineligibility too.

Now, the logo, <http://www.scientificlinux.org/documentation/graphics/logo> claims its GPL, but does not state a version. For the purposes of asthetics and compatibility, the logo files are considered to be under the GPL, along with any of the new art that contains it. However, since the GPL is not a good license for multimedia, I did e-mail the creator to see if it could be dual-licensed under the CC-BY-SA-3.0 license, much like the rest of the artwork files. But for now, let's leave it at that. If this were to occur, I will gladly re-license them under CC-BY-SA as well (I, just believe too much in license compatibility)

I am pretty sure that this time, all the upstream artwork is gone.
